CURRENTLY WORKING ON ========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Check compat with Animania's sleeping animation, the normal death animation, and any similar



Reorganize configs for...
...client -> HUD

General, easy to use T/F toggles for features in the configs...
...stealth gauge (client)
...targeting HUD (client)
...OPHUD (client)

Add keybinds for turning certain client config settings on/off...
...stealth gauge
...targeting HUD
...OPHUD

Make the difference between "barely unseen" and "barely seen" on the stealth gauge more noticeable...
...Change from using 1 color for stealth gauge to using 4 colors; 2 for a gradient from full stealth to barely unseen, and 2 for a gradient from barely seen to maximum visibility

Alter weapon tooltips to reflect settings for normal attacks and stealth attacks...
...requires sending clients data for attacks, based on server settings



Start making some of those tutorial videos



BUG FIXES ===================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Mobs in desperation mode can be put into flee mode by hitting them...
...fix by adding "desperation" status effect

Spiders path toward their threat target even if they can't see it (must have a threat target)...
...happens when all AI besides mine is removed, so either something to do with my AI or something outside AI, or both
...since it only happens with spiders and not other mobs, I'd think it has to do with something outside the AI, at least partially

Spider riders sometimes move really fast...is that normal?...
...comes from skeleton, not spider (removed all AI from spiders and it still happened)

Fix entities being able to attack through glass due to same raytrace being used for attacks and vision...
...is there some method used in all melee attacks that I can inject a raytrace into?
Fix entities attempting to path through diagonal walls; this may very well fix (or at least mostly fix) the issue below
Fix entities being able to attack through glass diagonally (because they can see through it...)
...fixing pathing should also fix some cases for "can't reach" since it relies on accurate pathing

Make stuck detection account for jumping by allowing for more play along y axis

Fix leashes not rendering sometimes (not a vanilla bug)...
...can reproduce by leashing a horse, flying into the air, and dropping into water while facing down

Fix "opaque flashing" of mobs on the edge of vision due to no visibility data -> defaulting to full visibility...
...occasionally happens on fade-in (rare)
...don't think it ever happens on fade-out anymore

HUD elements do not display in "fast" graphics mode...not that anyone uses fast graphics mode normally



GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS, SYSTEMS, AND FEATURES =================================================================================================================================================================================

Better potion handling on death (currently in LivingDropsEvent)...
...config list for potions
...config for whether list is blacklist or whitelist

Do more tests with large entities

Should the upper light limit and/or light level scaling of dimensions be changed as well...?
...at max light level, do blocks look brighter/darker in nether and end, or the same as overworld?
...at light levels between the "ambient" level and max light level, do blocks look brighter/darker in nether and end, or the same as overworld?

Add ally groups for helper system config

Alternate sneak mode, so as not to trigger "don't step off edge", ebwizardry staff spell selection, hooked grapple prevention, etc

Make client acquire target for any entity they have LOS to, then get the data for it from the map, as late as possible, if it exists
"Lock Target" key (press to lock/unlock current target)
...when target is locked, send target to server, which then allows you to see hud data even if it's far away
"Aim Assist" key (hold to automatically face current target)

Directional indicators...
...add optional "damaged from" indicator, which draws an indicator pointing the direction damage was recently received from
...add optional touch detection indicator for players (see to do in DynamicStealth.java)

Add creativeinvis command
True by default (creative mode players are completely invisible except to other creative mode players)

Add lang keys for all println() calls (make sure to use deprecated I18n, not the non-deprecated one)

"Noisiness" block trait; block filter to determine how much noise walking/running/landing makes

"Footprint Duration" block trait; block filter for how long visible footprints/tracks last on the block type.  Add (long to short); clay, snow, sand, mycelium, dirt, coarse dirt, podzol

Add disguise system and change mob heads so they use it instead
Add other mob heads to disguise system

Add a natural soul sight filter for CNPC factions



KEYBOUND ACTIONS ============================================================================================================================================================================================================

Attempt Stealth / Don't Attempt Stealth (if set to "Don't Attempt Stealth", you are very easy for things to notice)
Wave (decrease visual stealth for 1 second)
Whisper (make a small noise; altered villager conversation sound?)
Yell (make a loud noise; hurt sound?)
Prone/unprone - has a charge time; when prone, you are stealthier, slower, have a lower POV, have a smaller hitbox (can move through 1b high areas), and cannot jump/dodge/sneak
Find pebble?



CONFIG ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Add config option for "Can See Through" Materials
Add config option for "Can See Through" Blocks

Add entity-specific configs for helper system

Add entity-specific filter for OPHUD
Add entity-specific filter for targeting HUD



AI ==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)



SENSES ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Add scent-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.
Apply stealth-based scent attributes

Do sound mappings in library
Add sound-based detection
Apply stealth-based sound attributes



STATUS EFFECTS ==============================================================================================================================================================================================================

Keen Nose: Get visible indicators for scents and scent trails
Silenced: Cannot warn others
Deafened: Cannot hear
Fear: Makes them flee
Courage: Applies rally effect if they were fleeing; grants immunity to fleeing for the duration



BLOCKS ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Pitfall: Entity which destroys the dirt block it's on if something walks on it.



ITEMS =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Guidebook, possibly using guide api or patchouli

Water potions...yes...for applying the wetness effect (for normal one, try to make it usable faster and play water splash sound)
Fire potions, for burning effect

Water arrows (create a thin flowing water block on impact; for breaking torches and giving Wet status effect)
Fire arrows (set entities on fire or create fire on impact)
Torch arrows (yes I know some other mods already do, but I want them in mine)

Make sticks throwable (act like snowballs; 0 damage projectile, but if they hit a block, then instead create small sound.  Either way, drop as stick item again)

Hand mirror - Allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Pebbles - Can be thrown as a 0 damage projectile like a snowball, but drops as an item again on impact.  Crafted from cobblestone

Make firework stars throwable; they go off after a short delay, or if in water, drop as an item again

Slingshot - Can fire pebbles, smoke bombs, splash/lingering potions, or firework stars as low-damage projectiles



MOBS ========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MOD COMPATIBILITY ===========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Set Bonus integration for stealth attacks and assassinations

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Zombie Awareness (after all senses are done; even then, might need to make an API and have Corosis do the rest from his side)

Some TiC weapons don't trigger assassination for some reason...
...maybe one of the bonus damage things is interfering?
...the one I had this happen with had cold blooded, insatiable, a bone handle, flaming (blaze powder modifier)
...not from diamond or sharp (quartz)
